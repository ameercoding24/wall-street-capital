                        The Technology Division powers the infrastructure that keeps Wall Street Capital running smoothly. From maintaining our website to optimizing our Discord and ensuring bots function seamlessly, this team handles the behind-the-scenes systems that support every division. While prior experience with HTML, Python, or Cursor is preferred, it's not required—what matters most is a solid understanding of basic coding concepts like front-end/back-end operations and asset management. This division is perfect for those looking to apply their technical skills in a collaborative, fast-paced environment while learning how tech supports business at every level.

                        Members gain comprehensive, hands-on experience in modern web development practices. Using Cursor, our preferred IDE, they learn to build and maintain websites from the ground up—starting with HTML structure, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity through JavaScript. Through GitHub, members master essential version control concepts like branching, merging, and collaborative development. The division provides practical training in responsive design, ensuring our web presence looks and functions perfectly across all devices. Members also learn deployment processes, domain management, and how to use analytics tools to track and improve website performance. This real-world experience in web development and collaboration tools prepares members for both technical roles and cross-functional team leadership.
